\section{\label{sec:History-8-5}Development Release Series 8.5}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-5}Version 8.5.5}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.5 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.5.5 released on Month Date, 2016.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Docker Universe jobs now correctly advertise \Macro{RemoteUserCpu}
and \Macro{RemoteSysCpu} in their job ad and in the job log file.
\Ticket{5609}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-4}Version 8.5.4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.4 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.5.4 released on Month Date, 2016.

\item The \SubmitCmdNI{deltacloud} type in the grid universe, which allowed
submission to Deltacloud services, has been removed.
\Ticket{5569}

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Improved the performance of the \Condor{collector} by
not computing dropped update statistics, statistics which 
have never been accessible by users.
\Ticket{5566}

\item The performance of the \Condor{history} tool has been
significantly improved.
\Ticket{5536}

\item \Condor{user\_prio} now queries the \Condor{collector} for 
accounting information by default, when appropriate.  This should be
much faster than the older way of querying the \Condor{negotiator}. The
old path is still available by passing the -negotiator option to the
tool.
\Ticket{5508}.

\item The default value of \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_RUN\_POST} has been
changed from \Expr{True} to \Expr{False}.  This means that, by
default, if the PRE script of a DAG node fails, the POST script
of the node will \emph{not} be run.  (This had been the default
behavior until version 7.7.2.  The 7.7.2-8.5.3 behavior can be
restored by setting \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_RUN\_POST} to 
\Expr{True}, or by passing the new \Opt{-AlwaysRunPost}
argument to \Condor{submit\_dag}.)
\Ticket{5477}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-3}Version 8.5.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.3 released on March 24, 2016.

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \MacroNI{ENABLE\_IPV4} and \MacroNI{ENABLE\_IPV6} both now accept
the special value "AUTO", which is true if an interface with the corresponding
protocol exists on the host, and false otherwise.
\Ticket{5524}

\item \MacroNI{ENABLE\_IPV4} and \MacroNI{ENABLE\_IPV6} both now default
to the special value "AUTO".  Additionally, the new configuration macro
\MacroNI{PREFER\_IPV4} is true by default.  This macro causes HTCondor to
prefer IPv4 over IPv6 when choosing an address to advertise, when choosing
the address of daemon looked up in the collector, and when resolving DNS
queries.
\Ticket{5104}

\item New configuration macros added: \MacroNI{IPV4\_ADDRESS},
\Macro{IPV6\_ADDRESS}, \MacroNI{IP\_ADDRESS\_IS\_V6}.
\Ticket{5512}

\item New attributes have been added to the Submitter ClassAd to indicate
the number of Idle and Running jobs for Scheduler universe and for Local
universe.
\Ticket{5519}

\item Jobs can now be submitted to the SLURM batch scheduling system via
the new \SubmitCmdNI{slurm} type in the grid universe.
\Ticket{5515}

\item In addition to logging to the file \MacroNI{KERNEL\_TUNING\_LOG},
the default \MacroNI{LINUX\_KERNEL\_TUNING\_SCRIPT} now also logs to
syslog and \File{/etc/systcl.d/99-htcondor.conf}.
\Ticket{5489}

\item \Condor{history} \Opt{-autoformat} now supports the j option to print
job ids like \Condor{q} does.
\Ticket{5558}

\item HTCondor is now built and linked with Globus 6.0.
\Ticket{5520}

\item Pre-size the ClassAd hash table to improve the performance of the
\Condor{collector} when getting ClassAd updates.
\Ticket{5551}

\item The negotiator now forwards accounting information to the collector,
where it can be easily queried and monitored.
\Ticket{5491}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug on \Condor{history} that could result in truncation of
the job id field.
\Ticket{5527}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-2}Version 8.5.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.2 released on February 18, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Bold{\Condor{q} now defaults to showing only the current user's
jobs, unless the current user is a queue superuser.} This behavior
can be turned off by setting the new configuration option \Macro{CONDOR\_Q\_ONLY\_MY\_JOBS}
to \Expr{False} in the configuration for either the \Condor{schedd} or \Condor{q}. It can also be 
turned off by passing the new \Opt{-allusers} command line option to \Condor{q}.
\Ticket{5271}

\item Added support for immutable job attributes and protected job attributes.
\Ticket{5065}

\item Improved the speed of \Condor{q} and other tools when
querying non-local servers.
\Ticket{5150}

\item The new \Opt{-batch} command line option to \Condor{q} can be used to show a single
line of progress information for a batch of jobs, where a batch is either an entire workflow (a DAG, including sub-DAGs), all
of the jobs in a cluster, all of the jobs from a single user that have the same executable specified in their submit file,
or all of the jobs from a single user that have the same batch name.
\Ticket{4976}

\item \Condor{submit} and \Condor{submit\_dag} both have a new command line option \Opt{-batch-name}
which can be used to set the batch name used by \Condor{q} \Opt{-batch}.
\Ticket{5490}

\item \Condor{q} and \Condor{status} now attempt to avoid truncating data by making use of the
full width of the terminal.
\Ticket{5429}
\Ticket{5459}

\item Docker Universe jobs now report and update
ResidentSetSize, ImageSize, MemoryUsage, NetworkInput, and 
NetworkOutput attributes in the job ad and log file.
\Ticket{5456}

\item Added the capability to set ClassAd attributes for a
\Condor{dagman} job within the DAG file by using the new
\MacroNI{SET\_JOB\_ATTR} command.  (See section~\ref{sec:DAG-SetAttributes}
for details.)
\Ticket{5107}

\item The \File{dagman.out} file produced by \Condor{dagman} now has event
timestamps added to the lines that report \Condor{dagman} reading
a log event.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
  01/13/16 11:29:03 Event: ULOG_SUBMIT for HTCondor Node NodeA (674.0.0) {01/13/16 11:28:59}
\end{verbatim}
The timestamp in curly brackets at the end is the actual timestamp
of the event.
\Ticket{5439}

\item The \Opt{-run} and \Opt{-hold} arguments of \Condor{q} used to produce garbage output
when used with other formatting options such as \Opt{-format}.  Now they will always constrain
the query, and will also set the output format when used by themselves.
\Ticket{11}

\item The \Condor{status} \Opt{-verbose} argument has been removed;
the equivalent \Opt{-long} argument should be used instead.
% No ticket for this -- wenger 2016-02-11

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item On Windows, configuring HTCondor to restrict the range of outbound
port numbers may cause substantial delays when using the command-line
tools.  Since we now know that it's not free to do so, \MacroNI{LOWPORT}
and \MacroNI{HIGHPORT} no longer restrict the port numbers of outbound
connections on Windows.  If you still require this functionality, use
\MacroNI{OUT\_LOWPORT} and \MacroNI{OUT\_HIGHPORT}.
\Ticket{4711}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause a daemon to be in the wrong
privilege state when attempting to act as the user.
\Ticket{5467}

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-1}Version 8.5.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.5.1 released on December 21, 2015.

\item Shared port is enabled by default.
\Ticket{3813}
\Ticket{5103}

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{startd} history file now contains the peak
memory usage, by an exited job, not the more recent.
\Ticket{5436}

\item When the \Condor{starter} evicts a job, perhaps because
it has exceeded a memory limit, it does not transfer back to
the submit machine the sandbox of working files.  This is
consistent with other types of holds.
\Ticket{5437}

\item The \Condor{startd} now advertises the following attributes
on Linux machines: CpuFamily CpuModelNumber CacheSize.  These are
pulled from the /proc/cpuinfo file.
\Ticket{5323}

\item \Condor{q} has a new option \Opt{-schedd-constraint} which can be used
to constrain the queues displayed when using the \Opt{-global} option.
\Ticket{5043}

\item When an HTCondor-C job is submitted to a remote \Condor{schedd},
the remote job ad now includes the attribute \AdAttr{SubmitterGlobalJobId},
whose value is the same as the attribute \AdAttr{GlobalJobId} in the
original HTCondor-C job.
\Ticket{3472}

\item The \Condor{schedd} now sets environment variables for scheduler
universe jobs so that the jobs can more easily find the \Condor{schedd}'s
contact information.
On machines where there are multiple \Condor{schedd}s running, this helps
DAGMan and similar applications contact the \Condor{schedd} that started
them.
\Ticket{5166}

\item When \MacroNI{SEC\_ENABLE\_MATCH\_PASSWORD\_AUTHENTICATION} is set
to \Expr{True}, the related authorizations are now automatically enabled.
Previously, \Expr{submit-side@matchsession} and
\Expr{execute-side@matchsession} entries had to be added to the
\MacroNI{ALLOW\_DAEMON} and \MacroNI{ALLOW\_CLIENT} (if set)
authorization parameters in order for this feature to work.
\Ticket{5304}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item 

\Condor{history} \-run on a pool with partitionable slots now shows
the correct dynamic slot.
\Ticket{4261}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-5-0}Version 8.5.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

%\item HTCondor version 8.5.0 not yet released.
\item HTCondor version 8.5.0 released on October 12, 2015.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{startd} history file contains two new attributes: BadputCausedByDraining and BadputCausedByPreemption, two boolean-valued attributes which are true if the job was evicted not by a user request.
\Ticket{5255}

\item The python bindings have a new Claim API, allowing Computing-On-Demand (COD) to be
invoked via python.
\Ticket{5130}

\item The python bindings can now submit multiple distinct processes using the \texttt{submitMany}
method, similar to a \Condor{submit} file with multiple \texttt{queue} statements.
\Ticket{4916}

\item The python bindings now provide improved support for managing multiple concurrent queries.
\Ticket{5187}

\item As an experimental feature, the python bindings implement the HTCondor negotiation protocol.
\Ticket{5125}

\item Changed \AdStr{Condor} to \AdStr{HTCondor} in \Condor{dagman}
output (mainly in the \File{dagman}.out file).
\Ticket{5144}

\item The new configuration parameter \MacroNI{JOB\_SPOOL\_PERMISSIONS}
controls the permissions on a job's spool directory managed by the
\Condor{schedd} on unix.
It defaults to the value \Expr{user}, which results in a permissions
value of \Expr{0700}.
Other valid values are \Expr{group} (permissions \Expr{0750}) and
\Expr{world} (permissions \Expr{0755}).
Previously, all job spool directories had access permissions of \Expr{0755}.
\Ticket{4896}

\item The \Condor{schedd} no longer changes the ownership of spooled job
files that it manages.
Now, the files are always owned by the submitting user.
The previous behavior of changing ownership to/from the \Expr{condor}
account can be restored by setting the new configuration parameter
\Macro{CHOWN\_JOB\_SPOOL\_FILES} to \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{5226}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}
